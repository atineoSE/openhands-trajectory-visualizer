This can block automated testing and agent access to preview URLs.\n\n### Identifying Protected Deployments\n\nIf you encounter a login page or authentication requirement when accessing a Vercel preview URL, the deployment has protection enabled. Signs include:\n- Redirect to `vercel.com/login` or SSO login page\n- 401/403 errors when accessing the deployment\n- Preview URLs that require Vercel team membership\n\n### Enabling Agent Access with Protection Bypass\n\nTo allow agents and automated systems to access protected deployments, users need to set up **Protection Bypass for Automation**:\n\n1. **Navigate to Project Settings**\n   - Go to the Vercel Dashboard\n   - Select the project\n   - Click on **Settings** \u2192 **Deployment Protection**\n\n2. **Generate a Protection Bypass Secret**\n   - Under \"Protection Bypass for Automation\", click **Generate Secret**\n   - Copy the generated secret securely\n\n3. **Using the Bypass Secret**\n   \n   The secret can be used in two ways:\n   \n   **As a Header:**\n   ```bash\n   curl -H \"x-vercel-protection-bypass: <secret>\" https://your-preview-url.vercel.app\n   ```\n   \n   **As a Query Parameter:**\n   ```\n   https://your-preview-url.vercel.app?x-vercel-protection-bypass=<secret>\n   ```\n\n4. **For Browser-Based Testing**\n   - Append `?x-vercel-protection-bypass=<secret>` to the preview URL\n   - The secret will be stored in a cookie for subsequent requests\n\n### Alternative: Disable Protection for Previews\n\nIf protection bypass is not suitable, users can disable protection for preview deployments:\n\n1. Go to **Settings** \u2192 **Deployment Protection**\n2. Set \"Vercel Authentication\" to **Only Production Deployments** or **Disabled**\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nIf you cannot access a Vercel preview deployment due to authentication requirements, inform the user that they need to either:\n1. Set up a Protection Bypass secret and provide it to you, OR\n2. Disable Deployment Protection for preview deployments in their Vercel project settings\n\nDo NOT repeatedly attempt to access protected URLs without the bypass secret.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nSet environment variables in Vercel Dashboard under **Settings** \u2192 **Environment Variables**, or use the Vercel CLI:\n\n```bash\nvercel env add MY_SECRET\n```\n\nAccess in your application:\n```typescript\nconst secret = process.env.MY_SECRET;\n```\n\n## Vercel CLI Commands\n\nCommon Vercel CLI commands:\n\n```bash\n# Login to Vercel\nvercel login\n\n# Deploy to preview\nvercel\n\n# Deploy to production\nvercel --prod\n\n# List deployments\nvercel ls\n\n# View deployment logs\nvercel logs <deployment-url>\n\n# Pull environment variables locally\nvercel env pull\n```",

Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:\n- A cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nTo apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:\n\n1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.\n2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck\n3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme\n4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact\n\n## Themes Available\n\nThe following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:\n\n1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme\n2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors\n3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones\n4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale\n5. **Golden Hour** - Rich and warm autumnal palette\n6. **Arctic Frost** - Cool and crisp winter-inspired theme\n7. **Desert Rose** - Soft and sophisticated dusty tones\n8. **Tech Innovation** - Bold and modern tech aesthetic\n9. **Botanical Garden** - Fresh and organic garden colors\n10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones\n\n## Theme Details\n\nEach theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:\n- Cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Application Process\n\nAfter a preferred theme is selected:\n1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory\n2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck\n3. Ensure proper contrast and readability\n4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides\n\n## Create your Own Theme\nTo handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.",

In such case, update the remote URL to include the current token: `git remote set-url origin https://oauth2:${GITLAB_TOKEN}@gitlab.com/username/repo.git`\n\nHere are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:\n* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch\n* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the `create_mr` tool to create a merge request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a merge request, continue to update it.

Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a merge request, send the user a short message with a link to the merge request.\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could push changes with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\n```",

Poor feedback loops, missing documentation, or lack of tooling cause agents to waste cycles on preventable errors. This skill identifies those gaps and prioritizes fixes.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe user will run `/readiness-report` to evaluate the current repository. The agent will then:\n1. Clone the repo, scan repository structure, CI configs, and tooling\n2. Evaluate 81 criteria across 9 technical pillars\n3. Determine maturity level (L1-L5) based on 80% threshold per level\n4. Provide prioritized recommendations\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Run Repository Analysis\n\nExecute the analysis script to gather signals from the repository:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/analyze_repo.py --repo-path .\n```\n\nThis script checks for:\n- Configuration files (.eslintrc, pyproject.toml, etc.)\n- CI/CD workflows (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml)\n- Documentation (README, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Test infrastructure (test directories, coverage configs)\n- Security configurations (CODEOWNERS, .gitignore, secrets management)\n\n### Step 2: Generate Report\n\nAfter analysis, generate the formatted report:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/generate_report.py --analysis-file /tmp/readiness_analysis.json\n```\n\n### Step 3: Present Results\n\nThe report includes:\n1. **Overall Score**: Pass rate percentage and maturity level achieved\n2. **Level Progress**: Bar showing L1-L5 completion percentages\n3. **Strengths**: Top-performing pillars with passing criteria\n4. **Opportunities**: Prioritized list of improvements to implement\n5. **Detailed Criteria**: Full breakdown by pillar showing each criterion status\n\n## Nine Technical Pillars\n\nEach pillar addresses specific failure modes in AI-assisted development:\n\n| Pillar | Purpose | Key Signals |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n| **Style & Validation** | Catch bugs instantly | Linters, formatters, type checkers |\n| **Build System** | Fast, reliable builds | Build docs, CI speed, automation |\n| **Testing** | Verify correctness | Unit/integration tests, coverage |\n| **Documentation** | Guide the agent | AGENTS.md, README, architecture docs |\n| **Dev Environment** | Reproducible setup | Devcontainer, env templates |\n| **Debugging & Observability** | Diagnose issues | Logging, tracing, metrics |\n| **Security** | Protect the codebase | CODEOWNERS, secrets management |\n| **Task Discovery** | Find work to do | Issue templates, PR templates |\n| **Product & Analytics** | Error-to-insight loop | Error tracking, product analytics |\n\nSee `references/criteria.md` for the complete list of 81 criteria per pillar.\n\n## Five Maturity Levels\n\n| Level | Name | Description | Agent Capability |\n|-------|------|-------------|------------------|\n| L1 | Initial | Basic version control | Manual assistance only |\n| L2 | Managed | Basic CI/CD and testing | Simple, well-defined tasks |\n| L3 | Standardized | Production-ready for agents | Routine maintenance |\n| L4 | Measured | Comprehensive automation | Complex features |\n| L5 | Optimized | Full autonomous capability | End-to-end development |\n\n**Level Progression**: To unlock a level, pass \u226580% of criteria at that level AND all previous levels.\n\nSee `references/maturity-levels.md` for detailed level requirements.\n\n## Interpreting Results\n\n### Pass vs Fail vs Skip\n\n- \u2713 **Pass**: Criterion met (contributes to score)\n- \u2717 **Fail**: Criterion not met (opportunity for improvement)\n- \u2014 **Skip**: Not applicable to this repository type (excluded from score)\n\n### Priority Order\n\nFix gaps in this order:\n1. **L1-L2 failures**: Foundation issues blocking basic agent operation\n2. **L3 failures**: Production readiness gaps\n3. **High-impact L4+ failures**: Optimization opportunities\n\n### Common Quick Wins\n\n1. **Add AGENTS.md**: Document commands, architecture, and workflows for AI agents\n2. **Configure pre-commit hooks**: Catch style issues before CI\n3. **Add PR/issue templates**: Structure task discovery\n4. **Document single-command setup**: Enable fast environment provisioning\n\n## Resources\n\n- `scripts/analyze_repo.py` - Repository analysis script\n- `scripts/generate_report.py` - Report generation and formatting\n- `references/criteria.md` - Complete criteria definitions by pillar\n- `references/maturity-levels.md` - Detailed level requirements\n\n## Automated Remediation\n\nAfter reviewing the report, common fixes can be automated:\n- Generate AGENTS.md from repository structure\n- Add missing issue/PR templates\n- Configure standard linters and formatters\n- Set up pre-commit hooks\n\nAsk to \"fix readiness gaps\" to begin automated remediation of failing criteria.",

Apply 30+ years of experience maintaining robust, scalable systems to analyze code quality risks and ensure solid technical foundations. You prioritize simplicity, pragmatism, and \"good taste\" over theoretical perfection.\n\nCORE PHILOSOPHY:\n1. **\"Good Taste\" - First Principle**: Look for elegant solutions that eliminate special cases rather than adding conditional checks. Good code has no edge cases.\n2. **\"Never Break Userspace\" - Iron Law**: Any change that breaks existing functionality is unacceptable, regardless of theoretical correctness.\n3. **Pragmatism**: Solve real problems, not imaginary ones. Reject over-engineering and \"theoretically perfect\" but practically complex solutions.\n4. **Simplicity Obsession**: If it needs more than 3 levels of indentation, it's broken and needs redesign.\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:\n\nBefore reviewing, ask Linus's Three Questions:\n1. Is this solving a real problem or an imagined one?\n2. Is there a simpler way?\n3. What will this break?\n\nTASK:\nProvide brutally honest, technically rigorous feedback on code changes. Be direct and critical while remaining constructive. Focus on fundamental engineering principles over style preferences. DO NOT modify the code; only provide specific, actionable feedback.\n\nCODE REVIEW SCENARIOS:\n\n1. **Data Structure Analysis** (Highest Priority)\n\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures.\"\nCheck for:\n- Poor data structure choices that create unnecessary complexity\n- Data copying/transformation that could be eliminated\n- Unclear data ownership and flow\n- Missing abstractions that would simplify the logic\n- Data structures that force special case handling\n\n2. **Complexity and \"Good Taste\" Assessment**\n\"If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed.\"\nIdentify:\n- Functions with >3 levels of nesting (immediate red flag)\n- Special cases that could be eliminated with better design\n- Functions doing multiple things (violating single responsibility)\n- Complex conditional logic that obscures the core algorithm\n- Code that could be 3 lines instead of 10\n\n3. **Pragmatic Problem Analysis**\n\"Theory and practice sometimes clash. Theory loses. Every single time.\"\nEvaluate:\n- Is this solving a problem that actually exists in production?\n- Does the solution's complexity match the problem's severity?\n- Are we over-engineering for theoretical edge cases?\n- Could this be solved with existing, simpler mechanisms?\n\n4. **Breaking Change Risk Assessment**\n\"We don't break user space!\"\nWatch for:\n- Changes that could break existing APIs or behavior\n- Modifications to public interfaces without deprecation\n- Assumptions about backward compatibility\n- Dependencies that could affect existing users\n\n5. **Security and Correctness** (Critical Issues Only)\nFocus on real security risks, not theoretical ones:\n- Actual input validation failures with exploit potential\n- Real privilege escalation or data exposure risks\n- Memory safety issues in unsafe languages\n- Concurrency bugs that cause data corruption\n\n6. **Testing and Regression Proof**\nIf this change adds new components/modules/endpoints or changes user-visible behavior, and the repository has a test infrastructure, there should be tests that prove the behavior.\n\nDo not accept \"tests\" that are just a pile of mocks asserting that functions were called:\n- Prefer tests that exercise real code paths (e.g., parsing, validation, business logic) and assert on outputs/state.\n- Use in-memory or lightweight fakes only where necessary (e.g., ephemeral DB, temp filesystem) to keep tests fast and deterministic.\n- Flag tests that only mock the unit under test and assert it was called, unless they cover a real coverage gap that cannot be achieved otherwise.\n- The test should fail if the behavior regresses.\n\nCRITICAL REVIEW OUTPUT FORMAT:\n\nStart with a **Taste Rating**:\n\ud83d\udfe2 **Good taste** - Elegant, simple solution\n\ud83d\udfe1 **Acceptable** - Works but could be cleaner\n\ud83d\udd34 **Needs improvement** - Violates fundamental principles\n\nThen provide **Linus-Style Analysis**:\n\n**[CRITICAL ISSUES]** (Must fix - these break fundamental principles)\n- [src/core.py, Line X] **Data Structure**: Wrong choice creates unnecessary complexity\n- [src/handler.py, Line Y] **Complexity**: >3 levels of nesting - redesign required\n- [src/api.py, Line Z] **Breaking Change**: This will break existing functionality\n\n**[IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES]** (Should fix - violates good taste)\n- [src/utils.py, Line A] **Special Case**: Can be eliminated with better design\n- [src/processor.py, Line B] **Simplification**: These 10 lines can be 3\n- [src/feature.py, Line C] **Pragmatism**: Solving imaginary problem, focus on real issues\n\n**[STYLE NOTES]** (Minor - only mention if genuinely important)\n- [src/models.py, Line D] **Naming**: Unclear intent, affects maintainability\n\n**[TESTING GAPS]** (If behavior changed, this is not optional)\n- [tests/test_feature.py, Line E] **Mocks Aren't Tests**: You're only asserting mocked calls. Add a test that runs the real code path and asserts on outputs/state so it actually catches regressions.\n\n\n**VERDICT:**\n\u2705 **Worth merging**: Core logic is sound, minor improvements suggested\n\u274c **Needs rework**: Fundamental design issues must be addressed first\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:**\n[One sentence summary of the most important architectural observation]\n\nCOMMUNICATION STYLE:\n- Be direct and technically precise\n- Focus on engineering fundamentals, not personal preferences\n- Explain the \"why\" behind each criticism\n- Suggest concrete, actionable improvements\n- Prioritize issues that affect real users over theoretical concerns\n\nREMEMBER: DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE.

You can find the most up-to-date list of dependencies for your specific Linux distribution and version at the [Swift.org tarball installation guide](https://www.swift.org/install/linux/tarball/).\n\nFOR EXAMPLE, the dependencies you may need to install for Debian 12 could be:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y \\\n  binutils-gold \\\n  gcc \\\n  git \\\n  libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n  libedit-dev \\\n  libicu-dev \\\n  libncurses-dev \\\n  libpython3-dev \\\n  libsqlite3-dev \\\n  libxml2-dev \\\n  pkg-config \\\n  tzdata \\\n  uuid-dev\n```\n\n## Download and Install Swift\n\n1. Find the latest Swift version for Debian:\n\n   Go to the [Swift.org download page](https://www.swift.org/download/) to find the latest Swift version compatible with Debian 12 (Bookworm).\n\n   Look for a tarball named something like `swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz` (e.g., `swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz`).\n\n   The URL pattern is typically:\n   ```\n   https://download.swift.org/swift-<VERSION>-release/debian12/swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE/swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   Where `<VERSION>` is the Swift version number (e.g., `6.0.3`).\n\n2. Download the Swift binary for Debian 12:\n\n```bash\ncd /workspace\nwget https://download.swift.org/swift-6.0.3-release/debian12/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz\n```\n\n3. Extract the archive:\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to install Swift in the `/workspace` directory, but outside the git repository to avoid committing the Swift binaries.\n\n4. Add Swift to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\necho 'export PATH=/workspace/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12/usr/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to update the version number in the PATH to match the version you downloaded.\n\n## Verify Installation\n\nVerify that Swift is correctly installed by running:\n\n```bash\nswift --version\n```",

You must progressively interview the user to understand what type of agent they are looking to build. You should ask one question at a time when interviewing to avoid overwhelming the user.\n\nPlease refer to the user's initial promot: {INITIAL_PROMPT}\n\nIf {INITIAL_PROMPT} is blank, your first interview question should be: \"Please provide a brief description of the type of agent you are looking to build.\"\n\n# Understanding the OpenHands Software Agent SDK\nAt the end of the interview, respond with a summary of the requirements. Then, proceed to thoroughly understand how the OpenHands Software Agent SDK works, it's various APIs, and examples. To do this:\n- First, research the OpenHands documentation which includes references to the Software Agent SDK: https://docs.openhands.dev/llms.txt\n- Then, clone the examples into a temporary workspace folder (under \"temp/\"): https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk\n- Then, clone the SDK docs into the same temporary workspace folder: https://github.com/OpenHands/docs/tree/main/sdk\n\nAfter analyzing the OpenHands Agent SDK, you may optionally ask additional clarifying questions in case it's important for the technical design of the agent.\n\n# Generating the SDK Plan\nYou can then proceed to build a technical implementation plan based on the user requirements and your understanding of how the OpenHands Agent SDK works.\n- The plan should be stored in \"plan/SDK_PLAN.md\" from the root of the workspace.\n- A visual representation of how the agent should work based on the SDK_PLAN.md. This should look like a flow diagram with nodes and edges. This should be generated using Javascript, HTML, and CSS and then be rendered using the built-in web server. Store this in the plan/ directory.\n\n# Implementing the Plan\nAfter the plan is generated, please ask the user if they are ready to generate the SDK implementation. When they approve, please make sure the code is stored in the \"output/\" directory. Make sure the code provides logging that a user can see in the terminal. Ideally, the SDK is a single python file.\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n- Users can configure their LLM API Key using an environment variable named \"LLM_API_KEY\"\n- Unless otherwise specified, default to this model: openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929. This is configurable through the LLM_BASE_MODEL environment variable.\n\nIf the user didn't provide any of these variables, ask the user to provide them first before the agent can proceed with the task.",

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks\u2014they transform OpenHands from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else OpenHands needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: OpenHands is already very smart.** Only add context OpenHands doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does OpenHands really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of OpenHands as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 name: (required)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 description: (required)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions (required)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that OpenHands reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by OpenHands for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform OpenHands's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that OpenHands should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when OpenHands determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill\u2014this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output OpenHands produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables OpenHands to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by OpenHands (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nOpenHands loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 reference/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 product.md (API usage, features)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, OpenHands only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 references/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, OpenHands only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nOpenHands reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so OpenHands can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of OpenHands to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to OpenHands. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another OpenHands instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps OpenHands understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to OpenHands.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when OpenHands needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again",

Offer options when useful.\n- If the user is uncertain, propose **reasonable defaults** and continue.\n- Stop once you have enough info to create a **specific PR-ready plan**.\n- NEVER push directly to the main or master branch. Do not automatically commit any changes to the repo.\n\n## Interview Flow\n\n### **First question - always start here**\n> \u201cGreat \u2014 what are you trying to build or change, in one or two sentences?\n> (e.g., add an endpoint, fix a bug, write a script, tweak UI)\u201d\n\n### **Dynamic follow-up questions**\nChoose the next question based on what's most relevant from the last reply.\nUse one at a time - no more than 5 total.\n\n#### 1. Repo & Runtime Context\n- \u201cWhere will this live? Repo/name or link, language/runtime, and framework (if any)?\u201d\n- \u201cHow do you run and test locally? (package manager, build tool, dev server, docker compose?)\u201d\n\n#### 2. Scope & Acceptance Criteria\n- \u201cWhat's the smallest valuable change we can ship first? Describe the exact behavior or API/CLI/UI change and how we\u2019ll verify it.\u201d\n- \u201cAny non-negotiables? (performance, accessibility, security, backwards-compatibility)\u201d\n\n#### 3. Interfaces & Data\n- \u201cWhich interfaces are affected? (files, modules, routes, DB tables, events, components)\u201d\n- \u201cDo we need new schema/DTOs, migrations, or mock data?\u201d\n\n#### 4. Testing & Tooling\n- \u201cWhat tests should prove it works (unit/integration/e2e)? Which test framework, and any CI requirements?\u201d\n\n#### 5. Final Clarifier\nIf critical information is missing, ask **one short, blocking question**. If not, skip directly to the plan.\n\n## Plan Generation (After Questions)\nProduce a **PR-ready plan** customized to the user\u2019s answers, in this structure:\n\n### 1. Goal & Success Criteria\n- One-sentence goal.\n- Bullet **acceptance tests** (observable behaviors or API/CLI examples).\n\n### 2. Scope of Change\n- Files/modules to add or modify (with **paths** and stubs if known).\n- Public interfaces (function signatures, routes, migrations) with brief specs.\n\n### 3. Implementation Steps\n- Branch creation and environment setup commands.\n- Code tasks broken into <= 8 bite-sized commits.\n- Any scaffolding or codegen commands.\n\n### 4. Testing Plan\n- Tests to write, where they live, and example test names.\n- How to run them locally and in CI (with exact commands).\n- Sample fixtures/mocks or seed data.\n\n### 5. Quality Gates & Tooling\n- Lint/format/type-check commands.\n- Security/performance checks if relevant.\n- Accessibility checks for UI work.\n\n### 6. Risks & Mitigations\n- Top 3 risks + how to detect or rollback.\n- Mention feature flag/env toggle if applicable.\n\n### 7. Timeline & Next Steps\n- Rough estimate (S/M/L) with ordered sequence.\n- Call out anything **explicitly out of scope**.\n\n## Final Question\n**\u201cDo you want me to execute the plan?\u201d**",

            "content": "This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: OpenHands is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the `create_bitbucket_pr` tool to create a pull request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.\n* Do NOT mark a pull request as ready to review unless the user explicitly says so\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible.

Specific actionable recommendation\n2. Specific actionable recommendation\n```\n\n**For flexible guidance (when adaptation is useful):**\n\n```markdown\n## Report structure\n\nHere is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment:\n\n# [Analysis Title]\n\n## Executive summary\n[Overview]\n\n## Key findings\n[Adapt sections based on what you discover]\n\n## Recommendations\n[Tailor to the specific context]\n\nAdjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.\n```\n\n## Examples Pattern\n\nFor skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs:\n\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n\nGenerate commit messages following these examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput:\n```\nfeat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n\nAdd login endpoint and token validation middleware\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports\nOutput:\n```\nfix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion\n\nUse UTC timestamps consistently across report generation\n```\n\nFollow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.\n```\n\nExamples help OpenHands understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone.",

            "content": "# Agent Readiness Criteria\n\nComplete reference of all 81 criteria evaluated across nine technical pillars.\n\n## Criteria Format\n\nEach criterion is binary (pass/fail) and includes:\n- **ID**: Unique identifier (snake_case)\n- **Level**: Maturity level (1-5) where criterion is evaluated\n- **Detection**: How to check if the criterion is met\n- **Impact**: What happens when this criterion fails\n\n---\n\n## 1. Style & Validation\n\nAutomated tools that catch bugs instantly. Without them, agents waste cycles on syntax errors and style drift.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `formatter` | 1 | Prettier, Black, Ruff format, gofmt config exists | Agent submits code with formatting issues, waits for CI, fixes blindly |\n| `lint_config` | 1 | ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint, or language-specific linter configured | Style inconsistencies accumulate, harder to review |\n| `type_check` | 1 | TypeScript strict, mypy, Go (static by default) | Type errors caught late in CI instead of immediately |\n| `strict_typing` | 2 | TypeScript strict:true, mypy strict=true | Partial typing allows bugs to slip through |\n| `pre_commit_hooks` | 2 | .pre-commit-config.yaml or Husky config | Checks run in CI instead of locally, slower feedback |\n| `naming_consistency` | 2 | Linter rules or documented conventions | Inconsistent names make codebase harder to navigate |\n| `large_file_detection` | 2 | Git LFS, pre-commit check-added-large-files | Large files bloat repository, slow clones |\n| `code_modularization` | 3 | import-linter, Nx boundaries, Bazel modules | Architecture degrades over time |\n| `cyclomatic_complexity` | 3 | gocyclo, lizard, radon, SonarQube | Complex functions harder to understand and modify |\n| `dead_code_detection` | 3 | vulture, knip, deadcode in CI | Unused code clutters codebase |\n| `duplicate_code_detection` | 3 | jscpd, PMD CPD, SonarQube | Duplicated code increases maintenance burden |\n| `tech_debt_tracking` | 4 | TODO scanner, SonarQube, linter TODO rules | Tech debt accumulates without visibility |\n| `n_plus_one_detection` | 4 | nplusone, bullet gem, query analyzer | Performance issues in database queries |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build System\n\nFast, reliable builds enable rapid iteration. Slow CI kills agent productivity.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `build_cmd_doc` | 1 | Build commands documented in README/AGENTS.md | Agent doesn't know how to build |\n| `deps_pinned` | 1 | Lockfile exists (package-lock.json, uv.lock, go.sum) | Non-reproducible builds |\n| `vcs_cli_tools` | 1 | gh/glab CLI authenticated | Can't interact with PRs/issues |\n| `fast_ci_feedback` | 2 | CI completes in <10 minutes | Agent waits too long for feedback |\n| `single_command_setup` | 2 | One command to set up dev environment | Agent can't bootstrap quickly |\n| `release_automation` | 2 | Automated release workflow exists | Manual releases slow deployment |\n| `deployment_frequency` | 2 | Regular releases (weekly+) | Infrequent deploys signal process issues |\n| `release_notes_automation` | 3 | Auto-generated changelogs/release notes | Manual release notes are error-prone |\n| `agentic_development` | 3 | AI agent commits visible in history | No prior agent integration |\n| `automated_pr_review` | 3 | Danger.js, automated review bots | Reviews require human intervention |\n| `feature_flag_infrastructure` | 3 | LaunchDarkly, Statsig, Unleash, custom system | Hard to ship incrementally |\n| `build_performance_tracking` | 4 | Build caching, timing metrics | Build times creep up unnoticed |\n| `heavy_dependency_detection` | 4 | Bundle size analysis (webpack-bundle-analyzer) | Bundle bloat goes unnoticed |\n| `unused_dependencies_detection` | 4 | depcheck, deptry in CI | Bloated dependency tree |\n| `dead_feature_flag_detection` | 4 | Stale flag detection tooling | Abandoned flags clutter code |\n| `monorepo_tooling` | 4 | Nx, Turborepo, Bazel for monorepos | Cross-package changes are error-prone |\n| `version_drift_detection` | 4 | Version consistency checks | Packages diverge silently |\n| `progressive_rollout` | 5 | Canary deploys, gradual rollouts | All-or-nothing deployments are risky |\n| `rollback_automation` | 5 | One-click rollback capability | Slow recovery from bad deploys |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nTests verify that changes work. Without them, agents can't validate their own work.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `unit_tests_exist` | 1 | Test files present (*_test.*, *.spec.*) | No way to verify basic correctness |\n| `unit_tests_runnable` | 1 | Test command documented and works | Agent can't run tests |\n| `test_naming_conventions` | 2 | Consistent test file naming | Tests hard to find |\n| `test_isolation` | 2 | Tests can run in parallel | Slow test runs |\n| `integration_tests_exist` | 3 | E2E/integration test directory | Only unit-level coverage |\n| `test_coverage_thresholds` | 3 | Coverage enforcement in CI | Coverage drifts down |\n| `flaky_test_detection` | 4 | Test retry, quarantine, or tracking | Flaky tests erode trust |\n| `test_performance_tracking` | 4 | Test timing metrics | Slow tests accumulate |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Documentation\n\nDocumentation tells the agent what it needs to know. Missing docs mean wasted exploration.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `readme` | 1 | README.md exists with setup instructions | Agent doesn't know project basics |\n| `agents_md` | 2 | AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md exists | Agent lacks operational guidance |\n| `documentation_freshness` | 2 | Key docs updated in last 180 days | Stale docs mislead agent |\n| `api_schema_docs` | 3 | OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, or API docs | Agent must reverse-engineer APIs |\n| `automated_doc_generation` | 3 | Doc generation in CI | Docs drift from code |\n| `service_flow_documented` | 3 | Architecture diagrams (mermaid, PlantUML) | Agent lacks system context |\n| `skills` | 3 | Skills directory (.claude/skills/, .factory/skills/) | No specialized agent instructions |\n| `agents_md_validation` | 4 | CI validates AGENTS.md commands work | AGENTS.md becomes stale |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Dev Environment\n\nReproducible environments prevent \"works on my machine\" issues.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `env_template` | 2 | .env.example or documented env vars | Agent guesses at configuration |\n| `devcontainer` | 3 | .devcontainer/devcontainer.json exists | Environment setup is manual |\n| `devcontainer_runnable` | 3 | Devcontainer builds and works | Devcontainer is broken |\n| `database_schema` | 3 | Schema files or migration directory | Database structure undocumented |\n| `local_services_setup` | 3 | docker-compose.yml for dependencies | External services need manual setup |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Debugging & Observability\n\nWhen things go wrong, observability helps diagnose issues quickly.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `structured_logging` | 2 | Logging library with structured output | Logs hard to parse |\n| `code_quality_metrics` | 2 | Coverage reporting in CI | No visibility into code quality |\n| `error_tracking_contextualized` | 3 | Sentry, Bugsnag with context | Errors lack context for debugging |\n| `distributed_tracing` | 3 | OpenTelemetry, trace IDs | Can't trace requests across services |\n| `metrics_collection` | 3 | Prometheus, Datadog, or custom metrics | No runtime visibility |\n| `health_checks` | 3 | Health/readiness endpoints | Can't verify service status |\n| `profiling_instrumentation` | 4 | CPU/memory profiling tools | Performance issues hard to diagnose |\n| `alerting_configured` | 4 | PagerDuty, OpsGenie, alert rules | Issues discovered late |\n| `deployment_observability` | 4 | Deploy tracking, dashboards | Can't correlate issues to deploys |\n| `runbooks_documented` | 4 | Runbooks directory or linked docs | No guidance for incident response |\n| `circuit_breakers` | 5 | Resilience patterns implemented | Cascading failures |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Security\n\nSecurity criteria protect the codebase and data.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `gitignore_comprehensive` | 1 | .gitignore excludes secrets, build artifacts | Sensitive files committed |\n| `secrets_management` | 2 | GitHub secrets, vault, cloud secrets | Hardcoded secrets |\n| `codeowners` | 2 | CODEOWNERS file exists | No clear ownership |\n| `branch_protection` | 2 | Protected main branch | Unreviewed changes to main |\n| `dependency_update_automation` | 3 | Dependabot, Renovate configured | Dependencies go stale |\n| `log_scrubbing` | 3 | Log sanitization for PII | Sensitive data in logs |\n| `pii_handling` | 3 | PII redaction mechanisms | PII exposure risk |\n| `automated_security_review` | 4 | CodeQL, Snyk, SonarQube in CI | Security issues caught late |\n| `secret_scanning` | 4 | GitHub secret scanning enabled | Leaked credentials |\n| `dast_scanning` | 5 | Dynamic security testing | Runtime vulnerabilities missed |\n| `privacy_compliance` | 5 | GDPR/privacy tooling | Compliance gaps |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Task Discovery\n\nStructured task management helps agents find and understand work.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `issue_templates` | 2 | .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ exists | Inconsistent issue quality |\n| `issue_labeling_system` | 2 | Consistent labels on issues | Issues hard to categorize |\n| `pr_templates` | 2 | pull_request_template.md exists | PRs lack context |\n| `backlog_health` | 3 | Issues have descriptive titles, labels | Unclear what to work on |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Product & Analytics\n\nConnect errors to insights and understand user behavior.\n\n| Criterion | Level | Detection | Impact |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|\n| `error_to_insight_pipeline` | 5 | Sentry-GitHub issue creation automation | Errors don't become actionable issues |\n| `product_analytics_instrumentation` | 5 | Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Heap | No user behavior data to inform decisions |\n\n---\n\n## Skipped Criteria\n\nSome criteria are skipped based on repository type:\n- **Libraries**: Skip deployment-related criteria (progressive_rollout, health_checks)\n- **CLI tools**: Skip web-specific criteria (dast_scanning)\n- **Database projects**: Skip N+1 detection (they ARE the database)\n- **Single apps**: Skip monorepo tooling criteria\n\nThe analysis script automatically determines which criteria to skip based on detected repository characteristics.",
